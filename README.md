<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

All of ThirdAI's technology is powered by its BOLT library. BOLT is a deep-learning framework that leverages sparsity to enable training and deploying very large scale deep learning models on any CPU. This demos repo will help get you familiar with our products [Neural DB](https://medium.com/thirdai-blog/thirdais-private-and-personalizable-neural-database-enhancing-retrieval-augmented-generation-f3ad52c54952) and [Universal Deep Transformer (UDT)](https://www.thirdai.com/universal-deep-transformers/) through interactive notebooks.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# ðŸš€ Quickstart

## NeuralDB

NeuralDB is a personalized database for neural text search over your documents. It supports a wide array of document formats including CSV, PDF, and DOCX. NeuralDB is optimized to operate effectively on conventional CPUs, making it accessible to any standard desktop machine. Additionally, NeuralDB is designed with privacy at its core, ensuring your data never leaves your local machine.

With the capacity to scale search capabilities over thousands of pages, NeuralDB revolutionizes the way you interact with your data.

See the `neural_db` folder for more examples and documentation. 

## Universal Deep Transformer

Universal Deep Transformer (UDT) is our consolidated API for processing tabular data of any form. It handles text, numeric, categorical, multi-categorical, and time series input data while generalizing to multi-class classification, multi-label retrieval, and regression problems. Just like NeuralDB, UDT is optimized for conventional CPUs and is accessible to any standard desktop machine.

See the `udt` folder for more examples and documentation. 

<!-- LICENSE -->
# ðŸ“„ License

Many notebooks come with an API key that will only work on the dataset in the demo. If you want to try out ThirdAI on your own dataset, simply register for a free license [here](https://www.thirdai.com/try-bolt/). We look forward to hearing from you!

Please refer to `LICENSE.txt` for more information on usage terms.
