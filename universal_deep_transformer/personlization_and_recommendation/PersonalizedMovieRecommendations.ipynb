In this demo, we will train and evaluate the model on the Movielens 1M dataset, but you can easily replace this with your own dataset.\n",

Adding temporal context requires a single bolt.types.date() column to use to track the timestamp of training data.

This allows UDT to make better predictions for the target column by creating temporal features that take into account the historical relationship between users and movies."
