    "  \"Unlike with short-term memory, forgetting occurs in long-term memory when the formerly strengthened synaptic connections among the neurons in a neural network become weakened, or when the activation of a new network is superimposed over an older one, thus causing interference in the older memory.\",\n",
    "\t\"A neuron (also known as a neurone or nerve cell) is an electrically excitable cell that processes and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals. These signals between neurons occur via synapses, specialized connections with other cells. Neurons can connect to each other to form neural networks. Neurons are the core components of the brain and spinal cord of the central nervous system (CNS), and of the ganglia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS).\",\n",
    "  \"The activation level of a neuron in an artificial neural network is a real number often limited to the range 0 to 1, or â1 to 1. In the case of an input neuron the value is obtained externally to the network. In the case of a hidden neuron or output neuron the value is obtained from the neuron's activation function. In neural networks, an activation function is the function that describes the output behaviour of a neuron. Most network architectures start by computing the weighted sum of the inputs (that is, the sum of the product of each input with the weight associated with that input.\",\n",
    "  \"Deep learning refers to artificial neural networks that are composed of many layers. It's a growing trend in ML due to some favorable results in applications where the target function is very complex and the datasets are large. For example in Hinton et al.\",\n",
    "  \"The midbrain also contains a portion of the reticular formation, a neural network that is involved in arousal and alertness. Cranial nerves in the midbrain that stimulate the muscles controlling eye movement, lens shape, and pupil diameter form the nuclear complex of the oculomotor nerve and the trochlear nucleus.\",\n",
    "\t\"The bottleneck mechanism occurs when the first stimulus is being processed, any other stimuli cannot be processed. The processing of the second stimulus is postponed which slows down reaction time. Neurons that take in information send this information to specific neural networks in different locations.\",\n",
    "\t\"This module covers more advanced supervised learning methods that include ensembles of trees (random forests, gradient boosted trees), and neural networks (with an optional summary on deep learning). You will also learn about the critical problem of data leakage in machine learning and how to detect and avoid it.\",\n",
    "\t\"These neural networks power the speech recognition software, language translation, and semantic search facilities that Google, Facebook and many apps use today. Training a neural network so that it learns works similarly to establishing connections between neurons and strengthening those connections in the brain.\",\n",
    "\t\"It is a matter of contention within cognitive science whether explanation is properly conceived as the process and results of belief revision or as the activation of patterns within a neural network. This article focuses on the way thinking about explanation within the philosophy of science has changed since 1950.\",\n",
    "\t\"Deep learning refers to both deep neural networks and other branches of machine learning like deep reinforcement learning. In the press, it usually means deep neural nets. Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns.\",\n",
    "\t\"Today, the hottest area of artificial intelligence is neural networks, which are proving successful in a number of disciplines such as voice recognition and natural-language processing. There are several programming languages that are known as AI languages because they are used almost exclusively for AI applications.\",\n",
    "\t\"Meanwhile, the on-chip memory has increased from 1 GB on the Fathom NCS to 4 GB LPDDR3 on the Movidius NCS, in order to facilitate larger and denser neural networks. And to cap it all off, Movidius has been able to reduce the MSRP to $79 â citing Intelâs manufacturing and design expertiseâ â lowering the cost of entry even more.\",\n",
    "\t\"As Intel states, the Movidius NCS is âthe worldâs first self-contained AI accelerator in a USB format,â and is designed to permit host gadgets to course of deep neural networks natively â or in different phrases, on the edge.\",\n",
    "\t\"It has been estimated that the average human brain contains about 100 billion neurons and, on average, each neuron is connected to 1000 other neurons. This results in the generation of vast and complex neural networks that are the mainstay of the brain's processing capabilities. Neurons are the basic data processing units, the 'chips', of the brain. Each neuron receives electrical inputs from about 1000 other neurons.\",\n",
    "\t\"Auto-encoder What is an auto-encoder? Auto-encoder is one type of neural networks that approximates the function: f(x) = x. Basically, given an input x, network will learn to output f(x) that is as close as to x. The error between output and x is commonly measured using root mean square error (RMSE) â mean((f(x) â x) ^ 2) â which is the loss function we try to minimise in our network.\",\n",
    "\t\"An autoencoder is a neural network that is trained in an unsupervised fashion. The goal of an autoencoder is to find a more compact representation of the data by learning an encoder, which transforms the data to their corresponding compact representation, and a decoder, which reconstructs the original data.\",\n",
    "\t\"In computer science and machine learning, cellular neural networks are a parallel computing paradigm similar to neural networks, with the difference that communication is allowed between neighbouring units only. Typical applications include image processing, analyzing 3D surfaces, solving partial differential equations, reducing non-visual problems to geometric maps, modelling biological vision and other sensory-motor organs.\",\n",
    "\t\"what is cnn A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is comprised of one or more convolutional layers, pooling layers and then followed by one or more fully connected layers as in a standard neural network.\",\n",
    "\t\"Connectionism is an approach to the study of human cognition that utilizes mathematical models, known as connectionist networks or artificial neural networks. Often, these come in the form of highly interconnected, neuron-like processing units.\",\n",
    "\t\"The brain is a (biological) neural network: it's a network of neurons. Artificial neural networks, usually just referred to as neural networks, are computer simulations which process information in a way similar to how we think the brain does it.\",\n",
    "\t\"An artificial neural network (NN for short) is a classifier. In supervised machine learning, classification is one of the most prominent problems. The aim is to assort objects into classes that are defined a priori (terminology not to be confused with Object Oriented programming).\",\n",
    "\t\"To feed the input data to the neural network, we convert the data into features. Here, we will be using intensity values (of values 0 to 255) in our 20* 20 size images as input features for the algorithm; this makes the feature vector size for neural network to be 400.\",\n",
    "\t\"Word2vec is a group of related models that are used to produce word embeddings. These models are shallow, two-layer neural networks that are trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words.\",\n",
    "\t\"Deep Dream Generator is a platform where you can transform photos using a powerful AI algorithms. 1  You can create different types of Deep Dream and Deep Style images. 2  Deep Dream: Initially it was invented to help scientists and engineers to see what a deep neural network is seeing when it is looking in a given image.\",\n",
