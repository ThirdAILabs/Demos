    "# Pre-training and fine-tuning an LLM on CPU on AG News with ThirdAI's UDT\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will pre-train an LLM from scratch on the popular AG News Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amananandrai/ag-news-classification-dataset) using ThirdAI's Universal Deep Transformer (UDT). We will demonstrate how UDT can just pre-train on a small dataset and outperform the Semantic Search offering of OpenAI. \n",
    "\n",
    "This demo shows that one-model for all is sub-optimal and pre-training/fine-tuning on specific downstream datasets is required to get the best results.\n",
    "\n",
    "While most LLMs cannot be fine-tuned even on a powerful GPU, ThirdAI's UDT can train a billion parameter model on just a moderate CPU in few minutes.\n",
