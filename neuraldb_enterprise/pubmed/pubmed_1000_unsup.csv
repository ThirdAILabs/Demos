584,0,15564254,asciz regulates lesion-specific rad51 focus formation and apoptosis after methylating dna damage.,"nuclear rad51 focus formation is required for homology-directed repair of dna double-strand breaks (dsbs), but its regulation in response to non-dsb lesions is poorly understood. here we report a novel human sq/tq cluster domain-containing protein termed asciz that forms rad51-containing foci in response to base-modifying dna methylating agents but not in response to dsb-inducing agents"
585,1,15564254,asciz regulates lesion-specific rad51 focus formation and apoptosis after methylating dna damage.," asciz foci seem to form prior to rad51 recruitment, and an asciz core domain can concentrate rad51 in focus-like structures independently of dna damage. asciz depletion dramatically increases apoptosis after methylating dna damage and impairs rad51 focus formation in response to methylating agents but not after ionizing radiation"
586,2,15564254,asciz regulates lesion-specific rad51 focus formation and apoptosis after methylating dna damage.," asciz focus formation and increased apoptosis in asciz-depleted cells depend on the mismatch repair protein mlh1. interestingly, asciz foci form efficiently during g1 phase, when sister chromatids are unavailable as recombination templates"
587,3,15564254,asciz regulates lesion-specific rad51 focus formation and apoptosis after methylating dna damage.," we propose that asciz acts as a lesion-specific focus scaffold in a rad51-dependent pathway that resolves cytotoxic repair intermediates, most likely single-stranded dna gaps, resulting from mlh1-dependent processing of base lesions."

589,1,15564255,piasy mediates sumo-2 conjugation of topoisomerase-ii on mitotic chromosomes.," these properties were essential, since piasy mutants that did not bind chromatin or failed to recruit ubc9 were functionally inactive. we observed that piasy depletion eliminated essentially all chromosomal accumulation of egfp-sumo-2-conjugated species, suggesting that it is the primary e3-like factor for mitotic chromosomal substrates of sumo-2"
590,2,15564255,piasy mediates sumo-2 conjugation of topoisomerase-ii on mitotic chromosomes.," piasy-dependent sumo-2-conjugated species were highly concentrated on the inner centromere, and inhibition of piasy blocked anaphase sister chromatid segregation in egg extracts. taken together, our observations suggest that piasy is a critical regulator of mitotic sumo-2 conjugation for topoisomerase-ii and other chromosomal substrates, and that its activity may have particular relevance for centromeric functions required for proper chromosome segregation"

595,1,15564257,structural basis for recruitment of rilp by small gtpase rab7.," disruption of these interactions by mutations abrogates late endosomal/lysosomal targeting of rab7 and rilp. the rab7 binding domain of rilp forms a coiled-coil homodimer with two symmetric surfaces to interact with two separate rab7-gtp molecules, forming a dyad configuration of rab7-rilp(2)-rab7"
596,2,15564257,structural basis for recruitment of rilp by small gtpase rab7.," mutations that disrupt rilp dimerization also abolish its interactions with rab7-gtp and late endosomal/lysosomal targeting, suggesting that the dimeric form of rilp is a functional unit. structural comparison suggests that the combined use of rabsf1 and rabsf4 with the switch regions may be a general mode of action for most rab proteins in regulating membrane trafficking"

599,1,15564258,crystal structure of a seqa-n filament: implications for dna replication and chromosome organization., binding to multiple gatc sites is crucial for the formation of stable seqa-dna complexes. here we report the crystal structure of the oligomerization domain of seqa (seqa-n)
600,2,15564258,crystal structure of a seqa-n filament: implications for dna replication and chromosome organization.," the structural unit of seqa-n is a dimer, which oligomerizes to form a filament. mutations that disrupt filament formation lead to asynchronous dna replication, but the resulting seqa dimer can still bind two gatc sites separated from 5 to 34 base pairs"
601,3,15564258,crystal structure of a seqa-n filament: implications for dna replication and chromosome organization., truncation of the linker between the oligomerization and dna-binding domains restricts seqa to bind two gatc sites separated by one or two full turns. we propose a model of a seqa filament interacting with multiple gatc sites that accounts for both origin sequestration and chromosome organization

606,3,15564259,translation of aberrant mrnas lacking a termination codon or with a shortened 3'-utr is repressed after initiation in yeast.," these data suggest that ribosome stalling at the 3' end of nonstop mrna may block further rounds of translation, hence repressing protein synthesis. furthermore, it was found that the 5' --> 3' decay pathway was accelerated for nonstop mrna decay in the absence of ski7p"
607,4,15564259,translation of aberrant mrnas lacking a termination codon or with a shortened 3'-utr is repressed after initiation in yeast.," we also found that translation of aberrant mrnas with a shortened 3'-utr was repressed, suggesting that an improper spatial distance between the termination codon and the 3' end of mrna results in translation repression."
608,0,15564260,nova autoregulation reveals dual functions in neuronal splicing.,"the nova family of neuron-specific rna-binding proteins were originally identified as targets in an autoimmune neurologic disease characterized by failure of motor inhibition. nova-1 regulates alternative splicing of pre-mrnas encoding the inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor subunits gaba(a)rgamma2 and glyralpha2 by directly binding intronic elements, resulting in enhancement of exon inclusion"
609,1,15564260,nova autoregulation reveals dual functions in neuronal splicing.," here we identify exon e4 in the nova-1 pre-mrna itself, encoding a phosphorylated protein domain, as an additional target of nova-dependent splicing regulation in the mouse spinal cord. nova binding to e4 is necessary and sufficient for nova-dependent exon exclusion"
610,2,15564260,nova autoregulation reveals dual functions in neuronal splicing.," e4 harbors five repeats of the known nova-binding tetranucleotide ycay and mutation of these elements destroys nova-dependent regulation. furthermore, swapping of the sites from nova-1 and gaba(a)rgamma2 indicates that the ability of nova to enhance or repress alternative exon inclusion is dependent on the position of the nova-binding element within the pre-mrna"

991,2,15564335,polymorphisms at codons 56 and 174 of the prion-like protein gene (prnd) are not associated with sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease.," a strong significant difference of prnd genotype frequency at codon 174 was found between the normal korean population and various european populations. in contrast to results in the german population, our study did not show a significant difference in prnd genotype or allele frequency at codon 174 between sporadic cjd and normal controls"
992,3,15564335,polymorphisms at codons 56 and 174 of the prion-like protein gene (prnd) are not associated with sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease., this was the first genetic association study of the orf of prnd in an asian cjd population.
993,0,15564336,a novel locus of coralliform cataract mapped to chromosome 2p24-pter.,"congenital cataract is a common major abnormality of the eye, which can result in significant visual impairment or blindness in childhood. in this work, we studied four generations of a chinese family that exhibited autosomal dominant coralliform cataract but no other ocular or systemic abnormalities"
994,1,15564336,a novel locus of coralliform cataract mapped to chromosome 2p24-pter.," members of the family were firstly genotyped with microsatellite markers at loci associated with congenital cataract on the reported regions of chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, and 22, but negative lod scores were obtained. following exclusion of these loci, a genome-wide scan was performed, and significant evidence of linkage was obtained for marker d2s2211 (z = 2"
