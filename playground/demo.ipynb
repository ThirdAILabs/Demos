    "### How to teach your model (RLHF)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the marquee features that we provide. Thanks to our efficient training capabilties, we can offer you to teach the retrieval model to correct itself in the event of it not being able to get the correct paragraphs from the document. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the RLHF teachings done a model will generalize beyond the current documents if we run *model.clear_index()* and introduce new documents. This is because our engine has an elastic output space that adapts to the contents of new documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do RLHF, we provide two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Associate: Using this function, you can associate two phrases to give similar results. For examples, assume you're in the contract review domain. And you're interested in asking a question like \"who are the parties involved in this contract?\". However, most contracts have the phrase \"made by and between\" to suggest the parties involved in the contracts (like \"this agreement is made by and between company A and company B\"). In this scenario, you can simply call *model.associate([\"parties involved\",\"made by and between\"])* and the model would learn the relation. In the subsequent documents, you're more likely to retrieve the passage containing the correct information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Upvote: Let's say you searched for a query \"is there a limited liability clause?\" and you got 5 search results (along with their passage IDs). If you know that the corect result is actually the 2nd one instead of the first one. Then you can simpley call *model.upvote(\"is there a limited liability clause\",passage_id_of_the_best_search_result)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide two interfaces to do the teaching.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can simply teach the model as shown below in python with model.associate() and model.upvote() calls. Refer to the \"RLHF using Python functions\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You can save a checkpoint of your trained model and export it to our Playground web-app to do QnA and teaching on an intuitive UI."

    "In the above example, the model could not understand that the phrase \"date of signing\". But if you an expert in contracts, you know that \"date of signing\" usually goes with phrases like \"duly executed\" (for example, \"this Agreement has been duly executed by the parties hereto as of the latest date set forth below ...\"). So, let's teach the model that these two phrases should retrieve similar passages."
