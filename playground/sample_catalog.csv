0,,Inductive study compares related Bible texts in order to let the Bible interpret itself.  rather than approaching Scripture with predetermined notions of what it will say.  Dr. Trainas Methodical Bible Study was not intended to be the last word in inductive Bible study; but since its first publication in 1952.  it has become a foundational text in this field.  Christian colleges and seminaries have made it required reading for beginning Bible students.  while many churches have used it for their lay Bible study groups.  Dr. Traina summarizes its success in this comment:  "If the truths of the Bible already resided in man.  there would be no need for the Bible and this manual would be superfluous.  But the fact is the Bible is an objective body of literature which exists because man needs to know certain truths which he himself cannot know.  There are two main approaches open to the Bible student.  One is deduction.  which begins with generalizations and moves for their support to the particulars.  By its very nature deduction tends to be subjective and prejudicial.  Its opposite.  induction.  is objective and impartial; for it demands that one first examine the particulars of the Scriptures and that ones conclusions be based on those particulars.  Such an approach is sound because.  being objective.  it corresponds to the objective nature of the Scriptures."  This book fills the need for a simple.  practical textbook in hermeneutics.  It encourages the serious Bible student to practice the best kind of hermeneutic.  which allows the Word of God to speak for itself..       --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title..

2,,Just a few decades ago.  owing more money than you had in your  bank account was the exception.  not the rule.  Yet.  in the last 10 years.   consumer debt has doubled and.  for the first time.  Americans are spending  more than they're saving -- or making.  This April.  award-winning former  ABC News and CNN producer Danny Schechter investigates America's mounting  debt crisis in his latest hard-hitting expose.  IN DEBT WE TRUST.   While many Americans are "maxing out" on credit cards.  there is a  much deeper story: power is shifting into fewer hands...with frightening  consequences.  IN DEBT WE TRUST reveals a hitherto unknown cabal of credit  card companies.  lobbyists.  media conglomerates and the Bush administration  itself.  which has colluded to deregulate the lending industry.  ensuring  that a culture of credit dependency can flourish.  In the film.  Schechter  exposes the mechanisms and machinations behind the hidden financial and  political complex that allows even the lowest wage earners to indebt  themselves so heavily that house repossessions have become commonplace.   One expert in the film goes so far as to dub this "21st-century serfdom."   Inspired by scholar Robert Manning - one of the films' key  advisers' - and his seminal book "Credit Card Nation".  IN DEBT WE TRUST  showcases his insights about the impact of debt on young people and our  society.  It also suggests the kinds of practical efforts needed to empower  the public with information to avoid the traps of debt dependency.   The whole world depends on the economic stability of the United  States.  Yet.  as its national and consumer debt escalates.  our  interconnected global economy is at incredible risk.  IN DEBT WE TRUST.  as  timely and relevant as a film can be.  delivers an urgent warning that can't  be ignored.,,
3,,This black oil pressure gauge is engineered to provide extremely accurate readings under harsh conditions and measures the pressure of oil circulating through the engine. This oil pressure gauge has a 90 degree sweep.  0-100 PSI range.  and has a backlit dial face with Boudon tube meter movement. Air core movements and simple three wire installation are also included. This gauge is easy to hook-up and mount in your car and gives an advanced warning of incorrect oil pressure.  low oil level.  defective oil pump.  restricted oil lines.  clogged oil filter.  and low oil level.,,
4,,This polyoxymethylene spur gear with 20-degree pressure angle PA and a diametral pitch DP of 20 transmits torque between parallel shafts to provide rotational power to another part of a motorized system. It has a 20-degree pressure angle for lower contact ratio between gears.  resulting in higher load capacity than smaller pressure angles.  and a 20-diametral pitch for applications requiring a balance between transferring torque and controlling changes in speed and direction of rotation with precision. This spur gear.  which can mesh only with spur gears that have the same pressure angle and diametral pitch.  is made of polyoxymethylene for quiet operation.  low friction and moisture absorption.  and high resistance to heat and abrasion. This SmallParts spur gear is suitable for use in a variety of commercial and industrial applications.  such as construction equipment.  aeronautics.  conveyors.  and manufacturing equipment.  among others.Spur gears.  the most common gear type.  have a circular or cylindrical shape with teeth bordering the outer perimeter and are used for transmitting rotational torque and motion between parallel rotating shafts. A spur gear's pressure angle PA.  diametral pitch also called DP or pitch.  and its material are important factors to consider when purchasing. Gears come in several types for use in different power transmission configurations and for different applications.  including bevel and miter gears for rotating shafts perpendicular to each other.  change gears to increase or decrease torque and speed.  helical gears for high rates of rotational speed.  internal gears where one gear is nested inside the other.  rack and pinion gears for turning rotational motion into linear motion.  and worm gears for perpendicular shafts in tight spaces and quiet operation. Gears are suitable for use in the agriculture.  automotive.  construction.  mining.  and packaging industries.  and can be found in a variety of machines.  including bicycles.  automobiles.  and elevators.  among others.,,
