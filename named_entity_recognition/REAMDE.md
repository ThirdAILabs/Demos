This folder contains the notebooks to do Named Entity Recognition (NER) using ThirdAI's BOLT Engine.

The most popular use case for NER is to detect PII (Personally Identifiable Information) from text and potentially redact it before submitting it to any external agent/organization.

If you want to just use ThirdAI's pretrained PII detection model, please refer to the [pretrained_pii_model.ipynb](https://github.com/ThirdAILabs/Demos/blob/main/named_entity_recognition/pretrained_pii_model.ipynb) notebook.

If you want to train your own NER model on your data, you can refer to the [train_your_own_ner_model.ipynb](https://github.com/ThirdAILabs/Demos/blob/main/named_entity_recognition/train_your_own_ner_model.ipynb)
