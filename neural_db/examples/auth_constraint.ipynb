    "# **Enforcing Access Permissions with Document Metadata and Constrained Search**\n",
    "Large organizations have many documents and members. Not every member can access all documents. For example, they may only have access to:\n",
    "- documents within their department\n",
    "- documents with matching authorization levels tied to their position in the organization\n",
    "- a fine-grained set of documents\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how you can use NeuralDB's document metadata and constrained search to enforce these restrictions. At a high level, the process is as follows:\n",
    "1. Index each document with metadata containing its ID, department, and authorization level.\n",
    "2. When a user fires a query, get the user's department, authorization level, and set of allowed files.\n",
    "3. Constrain the search results to only include documents that match the user's department, authorization level, or allowed files set.\n",
