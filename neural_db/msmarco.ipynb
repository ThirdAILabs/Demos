    "\n",
    "While this system already achieves a comparable accuracy to the best Embedding Models, what if we want to improve it further? One of the defining characteristics of successful production search systems is their ability to continually improve based on user interactions. For example, say a company uses the custom acronym IDD to mean “initial design document”. Since this acronym doesn't appear in the training data used to create the LLMs in the search system, user queries like the “summarize the IDD for project xyz” will fail since the system doesn't understand the acronym used. With domain specialization the system can adapt to understand these relationships and answer queries like this correctly. These user interactions allow the underlying system to learn patterns/trends in user preferences that aren't present in the raw documents. "

The next generation of Nvidia H100 GPUs in production are alone projected to surpass the energy usage of a small nation. Finding energy efficient alternatives is essential as this technology continues to develop. A system like ThirdAI that uses only a fraction of the computing resources and requires no hardware accelerators offers a path to significantly less energy usage when deploying generative AI systems."
