    "\n",
    "1. Associate: Using this function, you can associate two phrases to give similar results. For examples, assume you're in the contract review domain. And you're interested in asking a question like \"who are the parties involved in this contract?\". However, most contracts have the phrase \"made by and between\" to suggest the parties involved in the contracts (like \"this agreement is made by and between company A and company B\"). In this scenario, you can simply call *ndb.teach_concept_association([\"parties involved\",\"made by and between\"])* and the model would learn the relation. In the subsequent documents, you're more likely to retrieve the passage containing the correct information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Upvote: Let's say you searched for a query \"is there a limited liability clause?\" and you got 5 search results (along with their passage IDs). If you know that the correct result is actually the 2nd one instead of the first one. Then you can simply call *ndb.upvote(\"is there a limited liability clause\",passage_id_of_the_best_search_result)*."
