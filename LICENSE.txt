documentation; (b) reproduce or modify the Software or any portion thereof, or embed the
Software or any portion thereof into any commercial services or offerings of Evaluator; (c)
sublicense, rent, sell, loan, lease, disclose, display, distribute, or otherwise transfer the

compromise or violation, by Evaluator employees, consultants, agents, customers, suppliers
or independent contractors, of such obligations and ThirdAI’s and its licensors rights and
title or interest to the Software. 
1.3. Enterprise Agreement. Upon the successful evaluation of the Software, the
parties shall work together in good faith to negotiate and enter into a definitive agreement
(“Definitive Agreement”) for use of the Software following the Trial Period. 
1. Confidentiality.
2.1. Definition. “Confidential Information” means any information disclosed by
either party (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other party (the “Receiving Party”) pursuant to
this Agreement that is (a) is in written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible form
and is marked “Confidential,” “Proprietary” or in some other manner to indicate its
confidential nature; or (b) in the case of oral or visual disclosure is identified as confidential
at the time of disclosure; or (c) under the circumstances should in good faith be considered
to be confidential. Confidential Information includes, without limitation, information related
to: research, Software plans, developments, inventions, processes, designs, markets,
business plans, agreements with third parties, services, customers, marketing or finances of
either party, the content or existence of any negotiations, and pricing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Software source code and all other non-public information regarding the
Software, including information related to its underlying algorithms, shall be deemed
Confidential Information of ThirdAI without any need for designating the same as
confidential or proprietary.
2.2. Obligations. Each party shall treat as confidential all Confidential Information
of the other party, shall not use such Confidential Information except as set forth in this
Agreement, and will not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party except as
expressly permitted herein without the Disclosing Party’s written consent. The Receiving
Party shall use at least the same degree of care which it uses to prevent the disclosure of
its own confidential information of like importance to prevent the disclosure of the
Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, but in no event less than reasonable care. The
Receiving Party shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party of any actual or suspected misuse
or unauthorized disclosure of any of the Confidential Information. In the event of any
termination or expiration of this Agreement, each Receiving Party will either return or, at
the Disclosing Party’s request, destroy the Confidential Information of the other Disclosing
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations set forth in this Section 2 shall not
apply with respect to any information to the extent that it is: (a) already rightfully in the
possession of the Receiving Party without restriction prior to the first disclosure hereunder
as shown by records or files; (b) is already or becomes generally available to the public
after the time of disclosure other than as a result of any improper action by the Receiving
Party; or (c) was rightfully disclosed to Receiving Party by a third party without restriction.
The Receiving Party may make disclosures required by law or court order provided that, if
practicable, the Receiving Party provides adequate notice and assistance to the Disclosing
GDSVF&H\7770994.1
Party for the purpose of enabling the Disclosing Party to prevent and/or limit the disclosure.
2.3. Remedies. Due to the unique nature of the Confidential Information, the
Receiving Party agrees that any breach or threatened breach of this section of this
Agreement will cause not only financial harm to the Disclosing Party, but also irreparable
harm for which money damages will not be an adequate remedy. Therefore, the Disclosing
Party shall be entitled, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies, to an injunction
or similar equitable relief against any such breach or threatened breach without the
necessity of posting any bond.
3. Proprietary Rights. 
3.1. Evaluator Data. To the extent Evaluator provides Evaluator Data (as

including all related Intellectual Property Rights. 
4. Fees. No fees shall be payable by Evaluator for the use of the Software

ThirdAI have any obligation thereafter to rent, lease, license or sell the Software to
Evaluator.
